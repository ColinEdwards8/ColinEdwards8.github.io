											<h3>Hi! I'm Colin!</h3>
										</header>
										<p>I am a Southern California native, but partial to true New York style Pizza. </p>
										<p>I recently made a change in careers from manufacturing quality control to software engineering. I spent nine years in manufacturing, starting as a quality control inspector, working my way up to supervisor, and then was able to manage my own quality department. At each company, I made sure to leave a lasting impact by performing every job with the highest standard. From medical devices to aerospace components, from West Coast to East Coast, I ensured each customer was receiving parts made to their specifications and delivered on time. As I begin my new career path in software engineering, I will carry over the passion and excitement for providing my team, my organization,  organization, and customers with an excellent product.</p>
										<p>I am an extremely driven and hardworking individual who strives for perfection with each new interest. While I loved finding and correcting the smallest errors in quality assurance for aerospace and medical manufacturing, I felt that I wanted to grow my career to something where I could not only correct the errors, but also build unique and elaborate features, and collaborate across multiple teams and businesses. </p>
										<p>I found software development as the perfect blend of my passion for details and for creative problem solving. Now, with my recent completion of the Hack Reactor 19-week advanced software immersive program, I am ready to start my new career as a software engineer. Having already proven  myself as a dedicated worker, and fast-learner, I know I will be able to keep up in various organizations’ hustle oriented environments. I am excited to learn each day, and practice new coding languages.</p>
										<p>Please do not hesitate to reach out to me if you would like to collaborate on a new project, or if you see a space that I can help fill at your company.</p>
										<p>Let’s work together! </p>
										<p>Colin Edwards</p>
